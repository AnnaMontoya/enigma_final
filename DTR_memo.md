Project: Enigma 

Group Member Names: Anna & Nico

Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project? Nico: TDD experience, aiming for objects to be single responsibility and make code as simple as possible (expectation isn't that it will be simple but simplicity is ideal.) Make it work! 
Anna: Similar to Nico in terms of TDD and simplicity. Our hope is to gain better understanding of combining classes/simplifying code. 

Goals and expectations: Nico wants to break the habit of finding online solutions and rely more on trial and error. Once something works, accept that we may understand the reasons why as more things come together and not stand still. 

Team strengths: Nico is very resourceful. Anna conceptually strong. Both of us are amicable and people oriented.

How to overcome obstacles: Take breaks! Ask for help and use mentors/upper modules as resources.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?): The project is number one priority and we want to spend as much time together as possible. Nico prefers minimal background noise so we intend to book rooms. 

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?): We're both very open communicators. We've loosely set the expection that we can contact each other whenever, but that response prior to 8am isn't likely. 

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement): We're both looking to improve our abilities to combine classes. We're both strong at visual mapping. Perceivably, Anna is better at composing tests, Nico better at developing code.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): Start on key generator a develop a nice, logical, file structure.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests): We plan to be working from the same computer and together for the vast majority of the time.
GIT WORKFLOW WILL LIKELY APPEAR MINIMAL FOR THIS REASON. 

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: We're both fairly open all the way around, and anticipate giving/receiving verbal feedback. 

Agenda to discuss project launch: Pour over spec/examples tonight. We've booked a full day together for Saturday and Sunday. Our intention is to have a rough draft by Monday and revise and implement future learnings throughout the week. 

Ideas: Individual mapping tonight. Really begin tomorrow.
